#  Machine Learning Fairness in Predicting Underweight, Overweight and Adiposity Across Socioeconomic and Caste Groups in India

This project investigates how fairly machine learning (ML) models can predict underweight, overweight/obesity, and central adiposity among older adults in Indiaâ€”specifically across caste and socioeconomic subgroupsâ€”using data from the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI). It was conducted as part of the study published in **[Journal Title or preprint server, 2025]**.

##  Objective

To evaluate and improve the fairness of ML models in public health prediction by:

- Assessing model performance on BMI-related outcomes
- Identifying bias across caste and socioeconomic groups
- Applying and comparing bias mitigation strategies (pre-, in-, post-processing)


## How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BMI_Fairness_India.git
   cd BMI_Fairness_India
Install requirements:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run notebooks in order (1 â†’ 5.4) for full pipeline.

## Methodology Breakdown
Notebook	Description
1_model_evaluation_bootstrap	Train & evaluate classifiers using bootstrapped AUROC, accuracy, etc.
2_prediction_density_analysis	Compare prediction distributions across caste/MPCE groups.
3_additional_features_analysis	Assess effect of socioeconomic & health features on model performance.
4_feature_importance_shap	Use SHAP to explain feature contribution to predictions.
5_1_fairness_baseline_subgroups	Stratify performance by subgroup to establish baseline unfairness.
5_2_bias_preprocessing	Apply pre-processing bias mitigation (reweighting, impact removal).
5_3_bias_inprocessing	Apply in-processing methods (adversarial, exponentiated gradient).
5_4_bias_postprocessing	Post-processing fairness techniques (equalized odds, ROC).
